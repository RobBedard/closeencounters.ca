							<p style="color: black;">What, if any, difference do close encounters with Jesus make in our lives? Spoiler alert: They make all the difference in the world! Like Peter, James and John, when we experience close encounters with Jesus, we too are transformed forever; we too are transformed for the better.<br><br>Read the book of Acts and notice who Luke spotlighted, and who he left in the shadows. The stories of Peter, James and John's close encounters with Jesus prove the point: To all who experience close encounters with Jesus, it will be said of them too, “these men had been with Jesus!” (Acts 4:13 NIV).<br><br>Close Encounters With Jesus will transport readers back in time to when Jesus first invited Peter, James and John to follow Him; to when Jesus invited the Three into three sacred places and spaces; and to when Jesus commissioned them individually to continue His prolific and powerful ministry in their unique callings.<br><br>Through in-depth Bible exposition, captivating storytelling, and insightful applications - plus a little humour sprinkled in for good measure - long-time pastor, teacher and disciple of Jesus, Rob Bedard, will lead readers where only Peter, James and John were invited to go: into three life-transformative close encounters with Jesus.</p>
